# Looking at the plot we can see that there is a slightly positive trend and seasonality going on.
# looking at it, it looks like the cabbage is more expensive in the beginning of the year (possibly due to weather/sparsity.)
# We can also see that this trend is additive rather than multiplicative, suggesting that we might not need a mathematical transformation)

Cabbage_filled %>% ACF(Average) %>% autoplot()

# Looking at the ACF we see a positive autocorrelation that decreases over time.It is hard to see any seasonality by this plot.
# But we see that this data is trended because the ACF of a trended time series tends to have positive values that slowly decrease as the lags increase.

# Now we can check if a box-cox would do any difference, we can first see if there is any heteroskedasticity
# the breusch-pagan test suggests that there is evidence of heteroscedasticity

# So we can see that the box-cox transformation actually did account for some variance.
# stabilize the variance of data. It achieveshttp://127.0.0.1:46763/graphics/eae0aabb-fca1-42fc-af17-adb617189384.png this by applying a power transformation to the data, 
# effectively adjusting the data to make its variance more constant, when we apply the Box-Cox transformation 
# to the cabbage data, it becomes more homoscedastic.

# Decomposition let's try different decomposition models and assess which one is the best.
# X11 only works on monthly or quarterly data - so those we can forget about - SEATS does not work either
